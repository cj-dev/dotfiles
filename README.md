# Chris's Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

# About
The VIM config currently uses a heavily modified Zenburn theme. Otherwise fairly vanilla in terms of function and keybinds.

There is also some x configuration and other miscellaneous bits.

# TODO
Everything else
* zsh
* awesome
* tmux

# Licensing
Anything I wrote is under The Unlicense as far as I'm concerned. I will do my best to include licenses for 3rd party plugins, themes, and whatnot as necessary and at least cite references wherever possible.
